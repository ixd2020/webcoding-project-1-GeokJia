          What is Impressionism?
        </h2>

      <p>
        Oscar-Cluade Monet, widely known as Monet, was a French artist born on
        14 November 1840 who founded the French Impressionism movement. Monet
        was a key figure in the founding of the movement and produced the most
        amount of paintings using Impressionism.
        <br /><br />Throughtout his lifetime, Monet has painted a whopping
        amount of <strong> nearly 2000 paintings. </strong>
        <br />
        Monet desired to record the French countryside, leading him to paint the
        same scene repeatedly to express the change of light and seasons. Some
        subjects of his paintings were the Routhen Cathedral, Charing Cross
        Bridge, and the Water Lilies.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>
        Monet's Technique
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Monet was the most prominent figure behind Impressionism. His lengthy
        career was mostly spent purusing Impressionism.
        <br /><br />
        In 1856, Monet’s coincidental meeting with Eugene Boudin, who painted
        small beach scenes, had opened Monet’s eyes to the prospect of plein-air
        painting.<br />
        From then on, he devoted himself to searching for fresh and improved
        methods of painterly expression. He visited the Paris Salon where he met
        older painters <br />
        and familiarised himself with their artworks. He had also made friends
        with other young aspiring artists. <br /><br />
        Spending 5 years at Argenteuil, he was mostly in a floating studio on
        River seine which had influenced his study of light and reflections. As
        a result of his study, instead of thinking in terms of scenes and
        objects, he thought in colours and shapes. Using bright colours in
        dabs,dashes and squiggles of paint, he rejected the academic teachings
        of Gleyre — one of his previous teachers.

        <br />
        After exhibiting his paintings that used his painting method of using
        dabs,dashes and squiggles of paint in 1873,he had received harsh attacks
        from critic, Louis Leroy, who coined the term Impressionism named after
        one of Monet's painting, Impression,Sunrise with the intention of
        disparaging Monet and the other artists but the artists would
        appropriate the term for themselves instead. <br />
        <br />The term surprsingly gained favour with the public, giving birth
        to what we know today as Impressionism. <br /><br />
        Some central figures behind the Impressionist movement other than Monet
        were, Frédéric Bazille, Berthe Morisot , Gustave Caillebotte,
        Pierre-Auguste Renoir and more.
