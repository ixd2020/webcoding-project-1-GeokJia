      <h2>
        Who is Monet?
      </h2>

      <br />
      <p>
        Oscar-Cluade Monet (1840-1926), widely known as Monet, was a French
        artist born on 14 November 1840 who founded the <br />French
        Impressionism movement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Monet was a key figure in the founding of the movement and produced the
        most amount of paintings using Impressionism. <br /><br />Throughtout
        his lifetime, Monet has painted a whopping amount of
        <strong> nearly 2000 paintings. </strong>
        <br />
        Monet desired to record the French countryside, leading him to paint the
        same scene repeatedly to express the change of light and seasons. Some
        subjects of his paintings were the Routhen Cathedral, Charing Cross
        Bridge, and the Water Lilies.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>
        Monet's Technique
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Having been described as "the driving force behind Impressionism".
        Monet’s career as a painter was mostly spent pursuing Impressionism.
        <br /><br />
        In his lengthy career, Monet constantly painted the scenery and leisure
        activities of Paris and its environment including the Normandy Coast.
        20th Century modernism was led by Monet by developing a special style
        that aimed to reproduce the very act of nature.
        <br /><br />

        />
        In his later works, Monet’s created a method of reproducing replicated
        studies of the same motif in series, switching canvases along with the
        light or along with his changing interests.

        <br /><br />

        Starting in 1877, he painted a series of paintings of St-Lazare Station.
        Monet observed the way smoke and steam influenced visibility and colour.
        Sometimes, it would be opaque and sometimes it would be translucent. He
        wanted to use the study to observe and paint the influence of mist and
        rain on the landscape. His studies of the atmosphere would then develop
        into a hefty number of series of paintings where Monet replicated the
        same subjects in changing lights at different timings of the day,weather
        and season. The series he painted were regularly exhibited in groups.
        For example, his images of haystacks (1890-1891) and the Rouen Cathedral
        (1894).

        In 1980, Monet became prosperous enough to buy a house at Givery and its
        surrounding land and properties for his garden. The gorgeous garden
        would eventually become the subject for some of his most famous
        works,such as the Water Lilies series and the greatest work of art in
        his life.
