          Who is Monet?
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Oscar-Cluade Monet (1840-1926), widely known as Monet, was a French
          artist born on 14 November 1840 who founded the French Impressionism
          movement. Monet was a key figure in the founding of the movement and
          produced the most amount of paintings using Impressionism.
          <br /><br />Throughtout his lifetime, Monet has painted a whopping
          amount of <strong> nearly 2000 paintings. </strong>
          <br />
          Monet desired to record the French countryside, leading him to paint
          the same scene repeatedly to express the change of light and seasons.
          Some subjects of his paintings were the Routhen Cathedral, Charing
          Cross Bridge, and the Water Lilies.

          Monet's Technique
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Having been described as "the driving force behind Impressionism".
          Monet’s career as a painter was mostly spent pursuing Impressionism.
          <br /><br />
          In his lengthy career, Monet constantly painted the scenery and
          leisure activities of Paris and its environment including the Normandy
          Coast. 20th Century modernism was led by Monet by developing a special
          style that aimed to reproduce the very act of nature.
          <br /><br />
          In his later works, Monet’s created a method of reproducing replicated
          studies of the same motif in series, switching canvases along with the
          light or along with his changing interests.

          />
          Starting in 1877, he painted a series of paintings of St-Lazare
          Station. Monet observed the way smoke and steam influenced visibility
          and colour. Sometimes, it would be opaque and sometimes it would be
          translucent. He wanted to use the study to observe and paint the
          influence of mist and rain on the landscape. His studies of the
          atmosphere would then develop into a hefty number of series of
          paintings where Monet replicated the same subjects in changing lights
          at different timings of the day,weather and season. The series he
          painted were regularly exhibited in groups. For example, his images of
          haystacks (1890-1891) and the Rouen Cathedral (1894).
